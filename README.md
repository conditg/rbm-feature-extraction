# Restricted Moltzmann Machine Feature Extraction
This notebook is a simple intro to creating features in facial recognition; specifically, it examines extracting features from images using a Restricted Moltzmann Machine.

The image set is [The Yale Face Database](http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/yale-face-database), which contains 165 grayscale images in GIF format of 15 individuals. There are 11 images per subject, one per different facial expression or configuration: center-light, w/glasses, happy, left-light, w/no glasses, normal, right-light, sad, sleepy, surprised, and wink.

Also credit to the creators of [this normalized](http://vismod.media.mit.edu/vismod/classes/mas622-00/datasets/) version of this dataset. The **centered** versions of the images are what are used in this analysis.
